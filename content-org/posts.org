** DONE Using org mode and ox-hugo to replace markdown in hugo workflow

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2019-01-01-using-org-mode-and-ox-hugo-to-replace-markdown-in-hugo-workflow
:END:

I have decided to give org mode blogging a go. Why org mode? The main reasons for this were:

- Abandon markdown: I always get confused by markdown markup choices. I find myself constantly reaching for [[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet][markdown cheatsheet]] to find out how to insert a link. "Is it parenthesis or brackets?" gets me every time;
- Increase familiarity with org mode synthax to use it in my literary programming workflows in the near future (tangle+babel);
- Reduce friction to create new blog posts using the great [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] by Kaushal Modi.

For anyone trying to do the same, I recommend:

- [[https://www.kengrimes.com/ox-hugo-tutorial/][ox-hugo tutorial by Ken Grimes]]
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo website/manual]]

- [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_org_markup.html][Most frequently used org mode markup by Xah]]

Since I want this post to be self contained for further reference in the near future, I will summarise what I've learned from the references above.

*** Installation and .emacs setup

#+begin_quote
*EDIT Apr 04 2020:* Instructions updated after noticing they failed in brand new system installation
#+end_quote

- Installation with package manager:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x package-install RET ox-hugo RET
#+end_src
- Require it in the .emacs file:
#+begin_src org
  (with-eval-after-load 'ox__
    (require 'ox-hugo))
#+end_src
- To take advantage of auto exporting on save I added the following to my .emacs file:
#+begin_src org
  ;; Hugo orgmode exporter
  (require 'org-hugo-auto-export-mode) ;If you want the auto-exporting on file saves
#+end_src
- Enable snippets shortcuts
#+begin_src org
  (require 'org-tempo);Enable snippets expantions (ex: <s+TAB or <q+TAB)
#+end_src
- Now to create a capture template to create new blog postos on the fly:
#+begin_src org
  ;; Populates only the EXPORT_FILE_NAME property in the inserted headline.
  (with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
    (defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
      "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
  See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
      (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
             (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
        (mapconcat #'identity
                   `(
                     ,(concat "* TODO " title)
                     ":PROPERTIES:"
                     ,(concat ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: " (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d-") fname)
                     ":END:"
                     "%?\n")          ;Place the cursor here finally
                   "\n"))))

  ;; org capture templates
  (setq org-capture-templates
   '(
     ("h"                ;`org-capture' binding + h
                      "Hugo post"
                      entry
                      ;; It is assumed that below file is present in `org-directory'
                      ;; and that it has a "Blog Ideas" heading. It can even be a
                      ;; symlink pointing to the actual location of all-posts.org!
                      (file+olp "/home/guilherme/blog/content-org/posts.org" "blog")
                      (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template))
  ))
#+end_src
- Include a /.dir-locals.el/ file in the project root, assuming all org-files are in a /content-org/ directory below root:
#+begin_src org
  (("content-org/"
    . ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))))
#+end_src

*Note:* everything here so far is in the manual. I only added the current date to the file name being created in the ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ property to be consistent with my previous naming scheme.

*** Org file structure

Ken grimes did a great job explaining how to use one org file to organize a hugo blog. I'll just mention a few things. First of all, Hugo has a contents folder and depending on the theme you use (I use cocoa) it will have 

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results output
  tree -d -L 2 ../content
#+end_src

#+results: 
: ../content
: ├── about
: ├── blog
: └── projects
: 
: 3 directories



I haven't been using ox-hugo in my previous posts, so I already have markdown files that do not have a corresponding org version. However, my posts reside in the blog folder. As an example, a minimal org file used to generate this post would be the following:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+hugo_base_dir: /home/guilherme/blog/
   ,* blog
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: blog
  :END:
   ,** TODO Using org mode and ox-hugo to replace markdown in hugo workflow
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2019-01-01-using-org-mode-and-ox-hugo-to-replace-markdown-in-hugo-workflow
  :END:

   ,* Footnotes
   ,* COMMENT Local Variables                          :ARCHIVE:
   # Local Variables:
   # org-hugo-auto-export-on-save: t
   # End:
#+end_src

The local variable ~org-hugo-auto-export-on-save~ with the ARCHIVE tag enables hugo auto export to my blog's master org file only.

*** Workflow

To create a new blog post I simply issue ~C+c C+c + h~ and a title for my new post is prompted. Along with it the filename with date are already set by the property in the capture template. Form now on I just write. 

To view any changes on my working post:

#+begin_src bash
  hugo serve -D --navigateToChanged
#+end_src

When done with the post, just changing the task from TODO to DONE will create a special property date that will be the post's date published.

*** Markup examples
I've put together some markup examples that were spread through the sources mentioned in the beggining of the post. These are for quick lookups, where I can find the synthax for features I use the most.

** DONE Generating documentation of Matlab scripts automatically with mkdocs

:END:

Something that always called my attention is how much more documented and even appealing to newcomers projects in python or R are if compared to Matlab in general. One exception is [[https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet][MatConvNet]], a library that implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Matlab and has a good looking and helpful documentation. 

The documentation stands out as it is produced with [[https://www.mkdocs.org/][MkDocs]], a static site generator based on markdown specific for project documentation. Something very different from Matlab's default html help template. But why bother adding another layer of complexity writing markdown files for the documentation? Why not use the source code itself? The authors of MatConvNet created a parser capable of extracting the comments of the functions in mfiles and auto generate the markdown necessary for MkDocs. The python scripts ~matdoc.py~ and ~matdocparser.py~ do exactly that. I must acknowledge it is copywrited material (Copyright (c) 2014-16 The MatConvNet Team) and not made by me.

For the remaining of this post consider a simple project composed of two mfiles: ~addme.m~ and ~subtractme.m~ which do exactly what you would expect from them, add and subtract two numbers. Also consider a ~index.md~ and a ~mkdocs.yml~ file, the bare minimum for a MkDocs documentation. This is the files setup and they can be downloaded from my github [[https://github.com/gtpedrosa/matlab-mkdocs][here]].

  .PHONY: all clean

** DONE Using httr with JSON API's                                   :R:APIs:
CLOSED: [2019-03-24 dom 11:35]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2019-03-24-using-httr-with-json-api-s
:END:

It is incredbly easy to make R interact with external API's. I've found [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html][the httr vignette]] to be a great resource on how to make a wrapper to interact with them. However I've stumbled in one quirk that is worth mentioning.

While creating a body to a POST request message, encoded with json, I verified that my requests were being turned down by the server. The issue was related  to a behavior of the ~jsonlite~ package, one of httr's dependencies which uses  ~auto_unbox=TRUE~ by default. This isn't an issue /per se/ but for length one vector jsonlite returned:

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
  cat(jsonlite:::toJSON(list(message = "my string"),auto_unbox=T))
#+end_src

#+results: 
: {"message":"my string"}



Whereas the API requested a *boxed* response from length one vectors, such the one you get without the ~auto_unbox=TRUE~ option

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
  cat(jsonlite:::toJSON(list(message = "my string")))
#+end_src

#+results: 
: {"message":["my string"]}



Reading [[https://github.com/r-lib/httr/issues/159][this github issue]] might give a more in depth explanation.

This led me to rabbit holes such as forking ~httr~ and recompiling with ~auto_unbox=FALSE~ option, which I did. But not without breaking other requests which truly needed to be unboxed.

The solution was simpler than I thought and makes use of the function ~AsIs~ from the base package. It can be called with the ~I(x)~ synthax and changes the class of an object indicating it should be treated /as is/. What this does is to prevent the ~auto_unbox~ behavior on certain fields where this is undesirable, such as in the following example: 

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
  cat(jsonlite:::toJSON(list(message = "my string",mymessage = I("My other string")),auto_unbox=T))
#+end_src

#+results: 
: {"message":"my string","mymessage":["My other string"]}



This approach not only did not break anything but also made my requests compatible with the server boxed length one vectors specification as required.
** DONE Using SQLAlchemy to navigate an existing database :python:ORM:Databases:
CLOSED: [2019-04-06 sáb 18:56]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2019-04-06-using-sqlalchemy-to-navigate-an-existing-database
:END:

Given the task to interact with an existing database I felt compelled to use the ORM abstraction instead of making queries with raw sql. My aim was to avoid the common pitfalls regarding making text templates for sqlqueries, prone to sql injection exploits, and enhance query composability. 

I've found there are essentialy two ways to approach this task: through reflextion or a declarative model. Both approaches are explained in the following sections.

*** SQLAlchemy reflection

Reflection uses metadata property to access schema constructs. It offers a few methods to access table objects, which do not have to be explicitly declared. 

The downside of this approach is mantainability, since schema changes can make code unreliable. Here's an eample of how to access the /TimeStamp/ column of a /Table_I_Want_to_Interact/ in a generic database:

#+begin_src python
  from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

  # Using SQLAlchemy reflection example
  engine = create_engine('connectionstringhere')
  table1meta = MetaData(engine)
  table1 = Table('Table_I_Want_to_Interact', table1meta, autoload=True)
  DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
  session = DBSession()
  results = session.query(table1).filter(table1.columns.TimeStamp>="2019-02-26 18:00:00.000")
  results.all()
#+end_src

*** SQLAlchemy declarative model

The declarative model needs Table objects to be explicitly declared. Due to this inherent verbose nature, I have found it is easier to grasp what is happening and even how the database is structured after a glance at the source code, such as in the following snippet:

#+begin_src python
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, BigInteger, CHAR, Column, DateTime, Float, Integer, SmallInteger, String, Table, Unicode, text
  from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
  from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

  Base = declarative_base()
  metadata = Base.metadata


  my_table_object = Table(
      'table_name', metadata,
      Column('Column1', Integer, nullable=False),
      Column('TimeStamp', DateTime, nullable=False),
      Column('Column3', Integer, nullable=False),
      Column('Column4', Unicode(2000))
  )
#+end_src

Here a table named /table_name/ in the database is being mapped to the /my_table_object/ instance. It should be noted that not all columns need to be mapped. Uninteresting columns can be left out with no drawbacks.

Depending on the database structure size, however,  it could be cumbersome to define multiple tables. For use cases like this, I have found the package [[https://pypi.org/project/sqlacodegen/][sqlacodegen]] of great help. It automates the task of creating the declarative models for you. Providing an output file and a connections tring it is as easy as issuing:

#+begin_src shell
  sqlcodegen --outfile models.py mssql+pyodbc......
#+end_src

The resulting file can be easily imported and the this task promptly abstracted.

This post is about how to inspect the content of SQL database (/.mdf/ and /.ldf/ files). The answer is to attach these files to an existing SQL server instance, instead of opening them directly with a tool such as SQL Management Studio. This was not clear time until I stumbled upon [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhIr9Qf-oHw][this video.]]

*** Steps

1. Keep a SQL Server instance running in the background;
2. Fire up SQL Management studio and connect to this instance by providing /.\SQLEXPRESS/ in the "Server name" field;
3. Right click "Database" and attach the mdf file. The ldf is automatically included;

*** Attention points

To check #1 spin up /SQL Configuration Manager/ and look for **SQL Server
(SQLEXPRESS)** instance. It should be already running by default, as shown in
Figure 1.

#+caption: SQL Express running instance
#+name: img:sqlexpress
[[file:/home/gtpedrosa/Projects/blog/hugo-blog/static/img/sqlexpress.png]]

As for #2 make sure to login using the system credentials as shown in Figure 2.

#+caption: SQL Server login
#+name: img:sqlserver
[[file:/home/gtpedrosa/Projects/blog/hugo-blog/static/img/sqlserver.png]]

As for #3, if you are not admin the mdf file needs to be stored somewhere in the
 Public user profile so the SQLExpress instance is able to locate it.

:END:

Recently, I wanted to restart blogging in a new machine. After installing the
latest hugo version at the time and pulling my git repo I soon realized:

1. Hugo version in which the blog was built was v0.31, whereas the current one
   was v0.68.1.
2. The cocoa development was abandonned and no updates were made to cope with
   hugo enhancements

Since I do like this theme and already had a fork of it I decided to try and
upgrade it by myself, even though I have no experience with the go programming
language or web development.

This post is to tell you how I went about it.

*** Finding where the errors come from

First of all, running the dated theme with new hugo raised the following errors:

#+caption: Running hugo serve on outdated template
#+name: oldtemplate
[[file:/home/gtpedrosa/Projects/blog/hugo-blog/static/img/hugo-warnings.png]]
*Hugo serve warnings on outdated template*

The first thing you may notice is that there is no mention to what part of the
template is raising the warnings being shown. To overcome this, I grepped the
offending structures and mapped which template files were triggering the
warnings:

#+caption: Finding out offending lines from hugo template
#+name: greptemplate
[[file:/home/gtpedrosa/Projects/blog/hugo-blog/static/img/hugo-warning-lines.png]]
*Hugo warning files and lines*

Just in case you are wondering here is a summary of the grep flags used:

- r or -R is recursive,
- n is line number, and
- w stands for match the whole word.

The next step involved fiddling with the source code and learning about each one of the errors.

*** Page.RSSLink is deprecated

I have found some github issues related to the matter, such as [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4427][this one.]]
However, what solved my issue was to read the docs [[https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/][here]] and look how an up to dated
template should handle RSS. Replacing the bit using the /.RSSLink/ construct
with the snippet below solved the issue.

#+begin_src html
  {{ with .OutputFormats.Get "rss" -}}
      {{ printf `<link rel="%s" type="%s" href="%s" title="%s" />` .Rel .MediaType.Type .Permalink $.Site.Title | safeHTML }}
  {{ end -}}
#+end_src

*** Page.URL is deprecated

This error was easier to tackle. The warning gave a reasonable solution that
worked in my case. By replacing /Page.URL/ with /.Permalink/ everything worked
as expected. Note that there was some trial and error here since there are other
two other possible options according to the warning. I iterated until success.

*** Page.UniqueID is deprecated

Again the warning suggestion was spot on and replacing /.UniqueID/ with
/.File.UniqueID/ supressed the warning.

*** Most recent blog posts not showing on index.html

This was the trickiest to fix. I ended up reading a little bit about [[https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/][how to
debug hugo templates.]] It so happens that after a couple of iterations printing
some of the variables in the /index.html/ file with the synthax

#+begin_src html
  {{ printf "%#v" .Permalink }}
#+end_src

I found out /.Data.Pages/ as not yielding the right ammount of posts.
Using /.Site.RegularPages/ did. I cannot find the exact resource which brought to
my attention the difference between the old and new hugo synthax, however, It is
agreeable that /.Data/ is too generic of a name for this use case.

*** Final result

As final result the theme is working without any warnings on hugo v0.68.1.

The changes applied to the theme are summarised by the git diff below. For more
reasonable view just check [[https://github.com/gtpedrosa/cocoa-hugo-theme][my fork of the cocoa-hugo theme.]]

** DONE Moving files on windows with python: shutil alternative
CLOSED: [2020-05-17 dom 11:20]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2020-05-17-moving-files-on-windows-with-python-shutil-alternative
:END:

Transfering data from my HD across a network, I have hit a bottleneck: the file
transfer speed was dramatically slow. In fact, the transfer took more time to finish than it took to generate the files. It was an unnaceptable situation due HD constraints.

It turns out that the file being copied to another partition is virtually
chunked, and each of them copied sequentialy. The more chunks the slower the
transfer is, while larger chunks increase memory usage [[https://superuser.com/questions/558292/how-does-copy-and-paste-for-large-files-work][[1]​]]. Iniatially I thought
I had to change the shutil module itself to make it work, so I avoided this
path [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21799210/python-copy-larger-file-too-slow][[2]​]].

The solution I came up, however, was switching to Windows Robust File Copy utility, or ~robocopy~. It has some perks, including showing the status of the
transfer on the command line, which was handy at this particular time. The
solution looks like the following:

#+begin_src python
  import time
  import os

  source = '\\source\\folder'
  target = '\\target\\folder'

  while True:
      for filename in os.listdir(source):
          os.system('Robocopy "%s" "%s" "%s" /MOV' %
                    (source, target, filename))
      time.sleep(300)
#+end_src

The python usage was only necessary to periodically move incoming files, keeping HD usage controlled.

#+begin_quote
**Attention:** Do not use ~/MOVE~ unless you want the folder structure to be
  moved as well. ~/MOV~ will keep the folder structure intact, moving only the
  files targeted.
#+end_quote

Later I have found out you can manage to adjust buffer size directly
without modifying the source code directly [[https://blogs.blumetech.com/blumetechs-tech-blog/2011/05/faster-python-file-copy.html][[3]​]]. I will keep that in mind for the
next time.

** DONE Setting up a Data Science local environment without administrative rights on Windows :data:science:windows:R:Python:Git:editors:IDE:
CLOSED: [2020-06-07 dom 18:24]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2020-06-07-data-science-local-environment-without-administrative-rights-on-windows
:END:

Installing any program on ~C:\Program Files~, Windows default installation folder, requires administrative rights. It is possible, however, to install programs on the ~HOME~ folder without any special permissions. The default ~HOME~ path is set to ~C:\Users\yourusername\~ and can be accessed by typing ~%HOME%~ on the address bar. I have found this approach makes it possible to have some autonomy from the IT department without compromising security.

Using this approach, the softwares will run just fine without any customization. One caveat, however, is that some set up is needed in order to make them interact with one another properly. 

The following list is a personal preference related to the tools used to perform the data science tasks I found easiest to setup without administrative (admin) rights and how to make them work without any problems.

*** Softwares

The main softwares I use are listed below:

- **Languages:** I use R mainly for data exploration/prototyping and Python for solution development. Bear in mind, however, that you can get some mileage with R exclusively depending on the need;
- **Editors:** I have installed notepad++, vim, emacs and Sublime Text 3. I end up using notepad++ for quick inspections of files, emacs for orgmode exclusively and Sublime for all my Python needs;
- **IDEs:** Why an IDE if you have a bunch of editors you might ask. Well, I find the experience of using RStudio for data explorations using R very well streamlined. Packaging works, I can do literate programming and weave the code into reports that work as an engineering memorandum and a reference for my future self or present analysis results;
- **VCS:** Git, indispensable in the analysis workflow and necessary to expand the toolbox set by pulling packages;

*** Configuration
**** Portable Programs

[[https://www.sublimetext.com/3][Sublime Editor]], [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][Git]], [[https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/][R]], [[https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/][RStudio]] and [[https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/][Python]] all have portable versions, which do not require any installation. If not, they allow you to proceed with the installation process selecting a folder of your choice, such as ~HOME~.

The downfall of this installation process is that none of the above programs will be on the system path, nor they will be available through the command line. Here is where the ~aliases.cmd~ comes in.

**** aliases.cmd

To make a program available system wide, it's path should be appended to the ~PATH~ variable. Unfortunately, doing this permanently is also a privileged operation. It is possible however, to append the new paths every time you start a terminal for instance. To accomplish this, you can take the following approach, borrowed from [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20530996/aliases-in-windows-command-prompt][this SO answer]]: 

1. Create a .bat or .cmd file with your DOSKEY commands.
2. Run regedit and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor
3. Add String Value entry with the name AutoRun and the full path of your .bat/.cmd file.
 
In my case, I have created a ~alias.cmd~ file in my ~HOME~ folder. The file is reproduced below:

   #+begin_src cmd
  @echo off

  :: Temporary system path at cmd startup

  set PATH=%PATH%;

  :: Commands

  DOSKEY ls=dir /B
  DOSKEY npp="C:\Users\yourusername\npp\notepad++.exe"
  DOSKEY alias=notepad %USERPROFILE%\alias.cmd
  DOSKEY vim="C:\Users\yourusername\Vim\vim81\gvim.exe"
  DOSKEY p1=cd "C:\Users\yourusername\p1" ^& "venv\Scripts\activate"
  DOSKEY va="venv\Scripts\activate"
  DOSKEY vd="venv\Scripts\deactivate"

  set curldir="C:\Users\yourusername\curl\bin\curl.exe"
  set gitdir="C:\Users\yourusername\PortableGit\cmd"
  set jupyterdir="C:\Users\yourusername\appdata\local\programs\python\python37\Scripts"
  set subldir="C:\Users\yourusername\Sublime"
  set rcdir="C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.17763.0\x64"
  set bashesdir="C:\Users\yourusername\bashes"
  set cmakedir="C:\Users\yourusername\cmake\bin"

  set pythonpath="C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37"
  set pythonscripts="C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts"
  set rdir="C:\Users\yourusername\R\R-3.5.1\bin"
  set PATH=%curldir%;%gitdir%;%cmakedir%;%pythonpath%;%pythonscripts%;%subldir%;%rcdir%;%bashesdir%;%rdir%;%PATH%
  #+end_src

Some interesting points about this configuration:

- Typing ~alias~ in the terminal brings me to the file above so I can tweak it easily;
- Part of my workflow with python relies on using virtual environments. I have a standardized name for my virtual environments which is ~venv~. Therefore, I alieased the actiavtion/deactivation from the project root to ~va~ and ~vd~. This works across all my projects;
- Usual projects received their own aliases, such as the ~p1~ example;
- Python, Git, curl and R could are appended to the system path;

Now, either running a new terminal or executing the software, you should feel no difference in usage regardless of how/where the tools were installed.

*** Failures

This blog post would not be complete if I did not talk about the things i could **not** get to work. 

**** WSL
I have previously used Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with success for personal projects. In fact, I believe that the [[https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-docker-tmux-and-vscode][setup proposed]] by Nick Janetakis is great. However, even asking for a privileged user to install and enable the WSL, I could not get it running with my unprivileged user. 
**** Docker
Similarly to what happened to the WSL, I have also tried to make docker available without any success. It seemed that all the changes made by a privileged user did not persist when I tried to use the installed software with my unprivileged credentials. 
**** Apache airflow
Apache airflow could not be installed without a admin rights. 

In fact it should, but I did not have Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools in my system, as per the error below.

#+begin_quote
error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
#+end_quote

Since it was not a pre requesite for my projects, I have not investigated any further.

**** MikTex
I still have not figured out how to properly set MikTex to R's path. Miktex has a portable edition that can be downloaded from [[https://miktex.org/download][MikTex download page]]. As of now, weaving documents to pdf are still unavailale in my system and will require further integration.

*** Closing Notes

This is a simple, yet useful standard of tools and ways of operating with them. It should be noted:

- I have not been working with tools for front-end, but did have npm installed recently to make slide decks with [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] using the same approach;
- My analysis are not really considered data-heavy. In the cases where they were more intensive, relying on libraries such as [[https://diskframe.com/][diskframe]] or caches worked fine;

Let me know if you managed to get WSL, docker or Miktex working, or have a set-up willing to share.

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2021-11-30-patterns-in-circle-of-fiths
:END:

Last Sunday I decided to start (re)learning some music theory by myself. The objective was to learn the scales and the entrypoint for that was the circle of fiths. I don't know why, but I felt the need to hold the circle of fiths chart I was consulting in my own hands. So instead of printing it I made my own, and while I was at it I thought it would be cool if the inner circle could spin, so I made it likewise. Here's the outcome:

#+caption: Handmade circle of fiths
#+name: cof
[[file:/home/gtpedrosa/Projects/blog/hugo-blog/static/img/circle_of_fiths.jpg]]
*Handmade circle of fiths chart*

The phisicality of it made me eager to play with this tool. Soon, I started gaining insights that might be obvious for a seasoned musician or someone who is proficient in theory. Nonetheless, here are some findings that I found amusing.

*** 1.Notes Interwined

Notice how by starting at **F**, it is possible to spot the following sequence: F_G_A_B. The underscores just mean that a note is skipped. The interesting part is that you can fill the gaps with another sequence: _C_D_E_, yielding the full sequence FCGDAEB. So 7/12 notes of the circle are easily spotted as the white notes on the piano. But what about the other 5/12?

*** 2.Accidental Simmetry

Well, if you pay close attention between **F** and **B** counterclockwise all notes have accidentals. Consider the sequence GDAEB, which are the notes of the circle clockwise after C. Now repeat them with a flat and you have found the remaining 5/12 notes from the circle!

*** 3.Identifying key from Key Signature

**** 3.1.Sharps

Add a semitone to the last sharp, or roughly add a note to it. For instance, what is the major key for a key signature with a single sharp (F#)? F+1=G.

**** 3.2.Flats

Drop the last flat. It does not work with the major key signature with only one flat, which is F. For instance **Bb** major has two flats: B and E. Drop the Eb (last flat in the signature) and you will have Bb itself.

*** 4.Sharps and Flats Relationship

Being a circle one could wonder whereas sharps and flats are interconnected. If we take a closer look at the sharps and flats sequences:

- **Sharps:** FCGDAEB
- **Flats:** BEADGCF

If you read the sharps backwards you get the flats! Also, the sharps are just the sequence of the circle of the fiths ranging from F to B clockwise. Just refer to the image and it is easy to verify. If you go counterclockwise from B to F you get the flats. 

*** 5.From Major to Minor and Vice-Versa

The major and minor scales can be obtained through the following interval composition:

- **Major:** TTSTT(TS)
- **Minor:** (TS)TTSTT

Here T stands for tone and S for semi-tone. The funny thing is, if you remove the last two intervals of a major scale (TS) and transfer it to the beginning of the remaining intervals (TTSTT) you get the minor scale formulation. This realization is even cooler in the circle itself:

#+caption: Spun inner circle of the circle of fiths
#+name: spuncof
[[file:/home/gtpedrosa/Projects/blog/hugo-blog/static/img/circle_of_fiths_spun.jpg]]
*Spun inner circle*

Here if you spin the inner circle by 1,5 tones (3 notes) you arrive at the same configuration as the major scale. So to obtain the relative minor to a major scale remove 1,5 tones from it. To derive the major from the minor add 1,5 tones. Example: What is the relative minor for D major? B minor. Try to see it on a piano, it is way easier. Another example the other way: What is the relative major scale to C# minor? E major. 
** DONE Migrating CI tool from travis to circleci for hugo blog on ghpages :dev:ops:hugo:ghpages:circleci:
CLOSED: [2021-12-05 dom 09:11]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2021-12-05-migrating-ci-tool-from-travis-to-circleci-for-hugo-blog-on-ghpages
:END:

When Travis CI was acquired by Idera, it didn't take long to cease its support for open source projects. This affected this blog since I overengineered it to learn some dev-ops skills. As result, I was forced to migrate the continuous integration (CI) tool from Travis to CircleCI. While I was at it, I took advantage and included a docker image for the build instead of declaring the dependencies installation as part of the CI build.

I am indebted to [[https://github.com/z0li/hugo-builder][z0li]] who provided a guide I was able to follow through [[https://z0li.github.io/deliver-static-sites-with-hugo-circleci-github/][here.]] The Docker image, config.yml and deploy scripts were modified from z0li's post.


*** 1.Docker Image 

This is the base Docker image upon which the blog is built. It still contains htmlproofer even though I am not using it at the moment. It is something either I'll adopt or drop in the future. It also contains, of course, hugo version 0.68.1 which is the last one I troubleshooted the cocoa theme for as detailed in my [[https://gtpedrosa.github.io/blog/upgrading-an-outdated-hugo-template/][previous post.]]

#+begin_src Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.6-alpine3.9

ENV HUGO_VERSION=0.68.1

RUN apk add --no-cache make gcc libc-dev bash libcurl ruby-nokogiri \
      openssh-client rsync git && \
    gem install --no-document html-proofer

RUN mkdir /tmp/hugo && \
    cd /tmp/hugo && \
    wget https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_${HUGO_VERSION}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz && \
    tar xzvf hugo_${HUGO_VERSION}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz && \
    mv /tmp/hugo/hugo /usr/local/bin/ && \
    rm -rf /tmp/hugo

CMD [ "hugo", "version" ]
#+end_src

*** 2. config.yml

This is where most of the action happens, the *config.yml* file required by CircleCI.

#+begin_src config.yml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: gtpedrosa/hugo-build:latest
    working_directory: /src
    steps:
      - add_ssh_keys:
          fingerprints:
            - "x4TBLAoCPktmU+ECc3aoxBPuymLldWBEaFpnR8yFDdE"
      - checkout
      - run: git submodule update --init
      - run: hugo -v -s /src -d /src/public
      - deploy:
          name: push to master branch
          command: sh /src/scripts/deploy_ci.sh
#+end_src

Notice:
- docker: it pulls the image previously uploaded to dockerhub and [[https://github.com/gtpedrosa/hugo-build/blob/master/Dockerfile][linked to my github repo.]]
- working_directory: specify the location to work from
- add_ssh_keys: include necessary credentials so circleci communicates to github
- checkout: special command to checkout the gtpedriosa.github.io repo
- first run: update submodules, in this case, the hugo theme used and [[https://github.com/gtpedrosa/cocoa-hugo-theme][fork that I mantain]], but designed by Nishanth Shanmugham
- second run: after pulling the code it runs hugo and saves the html in the usual *public* folder
- deploy: calls deploy script where the rest of action happens, which I'll document in the following section.

*** 3. deploy_ci.sh

Admitedly, I made inumerous mistakes in this transition. And learned a lot by trial and error, so here's the full file:

#+begin_src deploy_ci.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "* checking out the master branch:"
git clone --single-branch --branch master git@github.com:gtpedrosa/gtpedrosa.github.io.git master

echo "* synchronizing the files:"
rsync -arv /src/public/ master --delete --exclude ".git"
cp README.md master/

echo "* pushing to master:"
cd master
echo "cd OK"
git config user.name "CircleCI"
git config user.email "guilherme.pedrosa@gmail.com"
echo "git config OK"
git add -A
echo "git add OK"
git commit -m "Automated deployment job ${CIRCLE_BRANCH} #${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM} [skip ci]" --allow-empty
echo "git commit OK"
git push origin master

echo "* done"
#+end_src

Now, let's break it down in three parts and make some comments.

#+begin_src p1
set -e
#+end_src

The first excerpt causes the execution of the script to fail if an error is raised, instead of the default behavior of ignoring it. Therefore, any issues in the deployment will cause the build to fail.

#+begin_src p2
echo "* checking out the master branch:"
git clone --single-branch --branch master git@github.com:gtpedrosa/gtpedrosa.github.io.git master

echo "* synchronizing the files:"
rsync -arv /src/public/ master --delete --exclude ".git"
cp README.md master/
#+end_src

The html files in the master branch are cloned in this second part. The generated html pages from the hugo run (refer to the second run statement in the /config.yml/ file) are synced to the folder where the html files were cloned. Notice where they are coming from in the rsync argument. This is basically where the new posts are added to the previous ones.

#+begin_src p3
echo "* pushing to master:"
cd master
echo "cd OK"
git config user.name "CircleCI"
git config user.email "guilherme.pedrosa@gmail.com"
echo "git config OK"
git add -A
echo "git add OK"
git commit -m "Automated deployment job ${CIRCLE_BRANCH} #${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM} [skip ci]" --allow-empty
echo "git commit OK"
git push origin master

echo "* done"
#+end_src

Lastly, the changes are commited and pushed to master. This will update the ghpages site automatically. One detail to note is the /[skip ci]/ tag. From the documentation:

> By default, CircleCI automatically triggers a pipeline whenever you push changes to your project. You can override this behavior by adding a [ci skip] or [skip ci] tag within the first 250 characters of the body or title of the commit. 

If you ommit it, another job will be triggered and fail. This is messing up with the badge in the readme of the repository at this exact moment.

Also, any issue in the build can be debugged in the newly spun environment by [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/ssh-access-jobs/][sshing in an interactive shell.]] I really appreciated this to understand where I messed up with my paths.

Well, I hope this breakdown distilled some of the learnings in the process.

** DONE Installing Linux on HP 246 G6                  :linux:debian:driver:

:END:

Trying to speed-up my notebook HP 246 G6, I decided to upgrade my HD to a SSD. While at it, I have also decided to switch from Windows to Ubuntu. However, things did not go as smooth as I thought they would.

Firstly, I could not flash a new Ubuntu image successfully on my 16GB CruzerBlade thumbdrive. I used the [[https://www.balena.io/etcher/][Balena Etcher electron app]]. In case you have never used it before, just issue the following in the command line to get it running:

#+begin_src bash
sudo ./balenaEtcher-1.7.3-x64.AppImage
#+end_src  
 
 I do not remeber why, but it is worth noticing that running without privileges I ran into trouble. Same thing for *Gparted* used to format the CruzerBlade. I had to run it with **sudo** in order to work and format the thumbdrive, which would not work otherwise.

Image flashed, I moved on to installation. To select the booting device on a HP machine, press **F9**. Ubuntu GUI for installation appeared after HD check, but it would freeze before the installation process effectively started. Mind you this was Ubuntu 20.04 and found [[https://appuals.com/how-to-fix-ubuntu-20-04-installer-stuck-at-updates/][I was not alone with this issue]]. Without any success resolving it, I decided to give Debian a try.

I chose to download the DVD image, and re-flashed the CruzerBlade. Installation ran smoothly until the "Setup connection" part. It would not recognize my Wifi driver. After installation, I had add my user to sudo:

#+begin_src bash
su -
usermod -aG sudo username
exit
#+end_src

And restart the PC to take effect. To see if it worked, try to find **sudo** in the groups listed by 

#+begin_src bash

Before issuing any commands, I also had to remove the "CD Rom" drives as source for other software in Synaptic. Otherwise, no internet mirrors were reached for updates. Now I could finally update the system and download new software.

First thing to do is to findout the driver, which was easy after some search for the right command:

#+begin_src bash
lspci
#+end_src

It gave me that my Wireless Network Adapter was the Realtek RTL8723BE. Again, I was not the only one in trouble and found an excellent guide [[https://trendoceans.com/how-to-fix-rtl872be-no-wifi-network-connection-in-debian/][here.]] However, My fix was much shorter as It was already bundled in a [[https://debian.pkgs.org/10/debian-nonfree-amd64/firmware-realtek_20190114-2_all.deb.html][debian mirror in version 10]] and I had just installed Debian 11 LTS. So after installing it (with mirrors working now):

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install firmware-realtek
#+end_src

I had it working. I am writing this as a reminder to my future self of this little saga to get the notebook up and running.

After a Fresh install of Debian, I was suddenly surprised by the current lack of disk space to save a file. This post is a memo for my future self of how I managed to solve this issue.

In summary, the lack of disk space was caused by ever-growing logging messages stored on three files located in */var/log*: messages, kern.log, and syslog. What messages? Specifically these:

#+begin_src

Having no clue how to proceed, the following resources shed some light on how I should approach the issue:

- [[https://gist.github.com/Brainiarc7/3179144393747f35e5155fdbfd675554][Github gist]]
- [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1521173][Launchpad]]
- [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/195360/my-var-log-is-mysteriously-filling-up-gbs-in-minutes-any-cure-before-i-re-ins][StackExchange]]

Following the gist resource, I found that the offending Bus error was owed to my PCI (/Peripheral Computer Interface/) bridge. The bus info is exactly the one reported in the log files:

#+begin_src

#+end_src

After identifying the key information I tried to rewrite the base registry manually. The current output was:

#+begin_src 
guilherme@gtpedrosa:/var/log$ sudo setpci -v -d 8086:9d18 CAP_EXP+0x8.w
0000:00:1d.0 (cap 10 @40) @48 = 000f
#+end_src

And the expected output should be *000e* (according to the gist author). However, after trying to overwrite it:

#+begin_src 
guilherme@gtpedrosa:/var/log$ sudo setpci -v -d 8086:9d18 CAP_EXP+0x8.w=0x0e
pcilib: sysfs_write: write failed: Operation not permitted
0000:00:1d.0 (cap 10 @40) @48 000e
#+end_src

I got permission denied. **The only way to make sysfs_write work was to disable secure boot**. Only then, the above command ran without issue. It took me quite a while to figure this piece out. However, this only halted the logs in the current session, meaning that after a restart it would grow again until I re-issued the command. This led me to alter the grub file, as per the launchpad suggestion. The final answer involved editing */etc/default/grub* and replacing the existing *GURB_CMD_LINE_LINUX_DEFAULT* with the following:

#+begin_src 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=noaer" 
#+end_src

Emphasis on the *pci=noaer* option. What this does, according to the [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html][Linux Kernel manual]], is to disable the PCI Express advanced logging. Note that *grub-update* is necessary. This was only possible after disabling secure boot as well. The /how-to/ is in one of the answers of the StackExchange link.

Sadly, this is only a workaround. Probably, as per [[https://gtpedrosa.github.io/blog/installing-linux-on-hp-246-g6/][my previous post]], and [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1104219/what-does-pci-noaer-or-pci-nomsi-mean][this insight]], a hardware (my wireless driver) does not communicate with the kernel properly with MSI. Nonetheless, the HP notebook is ready for some serious work.

** DONE Setting up Debian 11 on my HP Pavillion dv7-6199us :linux:debian:driver:Ansible:chezmoi:

:END:

The HP Pavillion dv7-6199us has been my notebook for over 10 years. I accidentally trashed my system and could not fix it when it crashed during an upgrade. This led me to format it over, which was long due. Taking advantage of my previous experience with my other HP, the 246, I tried to install Debian 11 instead of Ubuntu. Here are my other findings during the OS switch.

Debian does not come with non-libre software. This is the reason the wifi driver was not supported [[https://gtpedrosa.github.io/blog/installing-linux-on-hp-246-g6/][previously]]. Following my notes, I was able to quickly set this up. Interestingly, I have found that the drivers are located at */lib/firmware* which I did not know before trying a manual install. I ended up installing all the available driver options by issuing 

#+begin_src bash
# Wifi proprietary driver 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install firmware-iwlwifi
ls /lib/firmware
#+end_src

Meanwhile, I have noticed the fan noise pretty loud since the startup. I tracked this issue to be related to my graphics card. I do not recall where I have found this info, but updating the graphic drivers did the trick:

#+begin_src bash
# Avoid fan overwork
sudo apt-get install firmware-amd-graphics libgl1-mesa-dri libglx-mesa0 mesa-vulkan-drivers xserver-xorg-video-all
#+end_src

These were quirks related to this device only. However, due to my recent system installation, I thought about how could I automate this process. My research showed that Ansible is quite a powerful tool worth exploring in this area. For simplicity sake, my first approach was to keep a bash script. It tracked all the software I needed and the commands necessary to set them up. I hope to turn it into an Ansible playbook in the future. Meanwhile here's the bash script:

On my [[https://gtpedrosa.github.io/blog/setting-up-a-data-science-local-environment-without-administrative-rights-on-windows/][previous post]] about setting up a data-science development environment without admin rights on Windows, there is a step where the registry needs to be edited. Recently, I have tried to follow the same instructions I wrote back then without success. It happens that the Command Processor entry cannot simply be found anymore.

In order to make my aliases stored on HOME directory initialize upon cmd startup, I have found the following work around:

#+begin_src bash
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%"USERPROFILE"%\alias.cmd" /f
#+end_src

It correctly autoruns the alias on cmd startup, solving the issue. More info on Microsoft’s docs.

I am trying my hand at carpentry and wanted to do some experimentations with a bookshelf of my own design. This led me to a search for a parametric CAD tool, where I could change determined design variables and have the model updated. OpenSCAD fitted the bill.

In under one hour I went from zero OpenSCAD knowledge to have a working model. The code itself is not optmized, but I was happy with the result. As resources go, I would recommend:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecd_eWPnynk&t=46s][Model a Code Brick by mathcodeprint]]
- [[https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/][OpenSCAD Cheatsheet]]

By following them I was able to produce a 3D model from a notebook sketch. Here's the result with the accompanying /.scad/  code:

Note that the model is incomplete. I did not model the drawers completely, as I wanted to nail the dimentions and proportions in order to produce a bill of materials that I could purchase and transport easily. As a caveat, I was not able to retrieve the final quotes from the 3D model. This is something I am willing to explore on another post if I find a solution. The ability to export the final model dimensions is a must for any work on the shop and bring this project to life.
** TODO Retrieving music sheet off midi visualizer in youtube videos using opencv part 1
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2019-01-15-retrieving-music-sheet-off-midi-visualizer-in-youtube-videos-using-opencv
:END:

I've been with [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj1qLa5jPrfAhUwHLkGHTNKBZsQyCkwAHoECAoQBQ&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253DDXP1KdZX4io&usg=AOvVaw2fnmqyhFJpLHe0x4F84Fcj][Radiohead's man of war song]] stuck in my head for over a week. While browsing youtube and waiting eagerly for Josh Cohen's songbook to come out, I stumbled upon another gifted youtuber pianist called Alex Franklin. Franklin also happened to have covered this song. In case you are wondering, here are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0GQtolLnEU][Josh's]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTfhYBCrKyc][Alex's]] versions of the song. 

Anyways, I saw the midi visualizer on the top of the piano keys on Franklin's cover and thought "oh my, I would really love to have the piano sheet for this". So here I am, trying to recognize the key strokes from a video and translate it into a piano sheet.

This is the first part of a series of posts (out of as many as needed) where I will publish the milestones of this journey as someone unitiated in visual recognition. The focus of this post is just to recognize the keystrokes of the left and right hands from an screenshot. This will require me to:

- Select the right tools for the job;
- Setup the development environment
- Detect the keys being pressed
- Define which hand is responsible for the keystroke
- Define the which musical note was played
- Translate the note to musical notation

And of course, time and will to persevere. 

*** The tools

I chose python as a programming language for it's ubiquitous presence in machine learning projects. Also for affinity. Python also has pre-built version of the /de facto/ standard library for computational vision: [[https://opencv.org/][OpenCV]]. Alternatives were [[http://tutorial.simplecv.org/en/latest/][SimpleCV]] and [[https://scikit-image.org/][scikit-image]], however I wanted to try the most popular and powerful tool out there.

Keystrokes recognized it is time to engrave them in a beautiful sheet. The GNU Project has a program called [[http://lilypond.org/][LilyPond]], which deals exactly with this task. LilyPond files are text files that can be easily manipulated using a library such as [[https://python-ly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][python-ly]] or even simpler as per [[https://www.python-course.eu/python_scores.php][this example]] using a simple correspondence map.

Docker to ease the pain. Reason in the next session.

*** The setup

OpenCV is written in C++ and I found it's installation everything but straightforward. Even with the excellent aid of [[https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/15/how-to-install-opencv-4-on-ubuntu/][Adrian Rosenbrock's tutorial]], I could not execute a simple:

#+begin_src python
  import cv2
#+end_src

without a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'". I tried many alternatives swith no success. This led me to download a Docker image and skip this problem altogether. The second image on dockerhub did the trick. The author Josip Janzic hosts it on github ([[https://github.com/janza/docker-python3-opencv][link here]]). It has a more recent version of python and opencv than the first image as of today's date. To get started just issue:

#+begin_src python
  docker run -it jjanzic/docker-python3-opencv python
#+end_src

And a working environment with opencv installed will be downloaded from dockerhub if a local image is not present. Needless to say you need to have Docker installed.

Since I've made a minor modification in the original Dockerfile, I had to rebuild the image and renamed it for this project:

#+begin_src python
  docker build -t vis_enc .
#+end_src

But nothing is perfect and while I was eager to try out some code, I got stuck with the following error:

#+begin_quote
cv2.error: OpenCV(4.0.0) /opencv-4.0.0/modules/highgui/src/window.cpp:625: error: (-2:Unspecified error) The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Cocoa support. If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script in function 'cvShowImage'
#+end_quote

Which led me to modify the Dockerfile yet again and rebuild the image. The final image is available in my github profile.
