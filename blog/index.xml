      <description>I have found a neat way to transfer single files or whole folders between two computers in the same network.
On one PC, turn it into an HTTP server:
python3 -m http.server And find its IPV4 address. Use ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux).
Finally, using a browser in the other PC, access the server on http://my_ip:8000. From there, you can navigate the file system and download single files easily or download whole folders using lftp:</description>

      <description>Suppose you need to highlight specific labels in a large bar or column chart in Excel. Here is a two-step way to accomplish the task.
With the COUNT.IF formula, you can detect if the current label belongs to a list of specific ones. The neat trick, however, is in the number formatting used to show the labels of interest exclusively:
[=0]&amp;quot;&amp;quot;;0% The formatting makes the cell show empty when zero (default output of the COUNT.</description>

      <description>I want to expand on the previous post Getting started with nvim touching upon the jupyter-lab integration. I am still unpleased with the current solution, but the following trick addresses a couple of issues.
Jupyter-lab comes with an IPython interpreter, which in turn has an auto-reload extension. It can be enabled easily as:
%load_ext autoreload %autoreload 2 The magic command set to &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo; reloads every module before any code is executed.</description>

      <description>This week I wanted to up my python development `fu` by focusing on my tooling. My main criterium was to move fast between definitions and files to understand a new code base. For a while, I have been learning about vim from the ThePrimeagen Youtube channel. His latest video on getting started with Neovim is simply an excellent resource.
So I took the time to implement each step following the video.</description>

      <description>Before diving into solar simulations with PVLib, one of the main concerns I had was how to use the same inputs given to PVSyst, the de facto standard software of the solar industry. That also meant using the same files that describe the main equipments: PAN files for the modules and OND files for the inverters.
Although It surprised me that PVLib did not come with a PVSyst file&amp;rsquo;s parser, It was not a deal breaker.</description>

      <description>While working on a python project today, the internet connection went down. For a while, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t reference some API documentation online. This got me thinking: could I have them all offline? Later on (with connection!), I have found the answer: an offline documentation tool called Zeal.
If the project you are working on is popular, there are already docsets available for download. This will make the documentation for a given package accessible in the blink of an eye!</description>

      <description>The easiest way to install a minimal LaTeX installation to use moderncv was using the debian package repository:
sudo apt install texlive sudo apt install texlive-lang-portuguese Note to self: I tried to install the vanilla texlive systemwide without the full installation (~7Gb) by using the graphical capability if install-tl but could not get tlmgr to work properly, even after adding the installation path to my .bashrc.</description>

      <description>After finishing the book &amp;ldquo;How to take smart notes&amp;rdquo; by SÃ¶nke Ahrens, I came to realize the following: I have been exposed to two ways to learn that use notes as a basis of the system. The first is embodied by the Zettlekasten and depicted through Ahrens&amp;rsquo; book. The second relies on spaced repetition and Ankification of notes if you will.
It is only natural to question myself which way (if any at all) I have found best suited for me.</description>

      <description>Recently, I and a colleague had a poster accepted to a conference we wanted to attend. Yay! However, we also had to send a video with the poster pitch along with the poster itself. And there, my friend, was an unanticipated challenge!
First of all, we found out about the video close to the deadline. Our fault. Then, it was difficult and confusing to figure out the etiquette of the whole thing.</description>

      <title>Add ssh-key to Keychain for Session Authentication</title>

      <description>Since github retired hhtp authentication, I have moved to the only option available: ssh-key authentication. It makes things easier by not having to type user and password multiple times in the same session. In theory. In practice, this was not my experience. This is when i found out about keychain. From their docs:
 Keychain helps you to manage SSH and GPG keys in a convenient and secure manner. It acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you to easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather than the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.</description>

      <description>I am trying my hand at carpentry and wanted to do some experimentations with a bookshelf of my own design. This led me to a search for a parametric CAD tool, where I could change determined design variables and have the model updated. OpenSCAD fitted the bill.
In under one hour I went from zero OpenSCAD knowledge to have a working model. The code itself is not optmized, but I was happy with the result.</description>

      <description>On my previous post about setting up a data-science development environment without admin rights on Windows, there is a step where the registry needs to be edited. Recently, I have tried to follow the same instructions I wrote back then without success. It happens that the Command Processor entry cannot simply be found anymore.
In order to make my aliases stored on HOME directory initialize upon cmd startup, I have found the following work around:</description>

      <description>The HP Pavillion dv7-6199us has been my notebook for over 10 years. I accidentally trashed my system and could not fix it when it crashed during an upgrade. This led me to format it over, which was long due. Taking advantage of my previous experience with my other HP, the 246, I tried to install Debian 11 instead of Ubuntu. Here are my other findings during the OS switch.
Debian does not come with non-libre software.</description>

      <description>After a Fresh install of Debian, I was suddenly surprised by the current lack of disk space to save a file. This post is a memo for my future self of how I managed to solve this issue.
In summary, the lack of disk space was caused by ever-growing logging messages stored on three files located in /var/log: messages, kern.log, and syslog. What messages? Specifically these:
guilherme@gtpedrosa: sudo tail syslog Mar 5 12:11:50 gtpedrosa kernel: [ 256.</description>

      <description>Trying to speed-up my notebook HP 246 G6, I decided to upgrade my HD to a SSD. While at it, I have also decided to switch from Windows to Ubuntu. However, things did not go as smooth as I thought they would.
Firstly, I could not flash a new Ubuntu image successfully on my 16GB CruzerBlade thumbdrive. I used the Balena Etcher electron app. In case you have never used it before, just issue the following in the command line to get it running:</description>

      <description>When Travis CI was acquired by Idera, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to cease its support for open source projects. This affected this blog since I overengineered it to learn some dev-ops skills. As result, I was forced to migrate the continuous integration (CI) tool from Travis to CircleCI. While I was at it, I took advantage and included a docker image for the build instead of declaring the dependencies installation as part of the CI build.</description>

      <description>Last Sunday I decided to start (re)learning some music theory by myself. The objective was to learn the scales and the entrypoint for that was the circle of fiths. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I felt the need to hold the circle of fiths chart I was consulting in my own hands. So instead of printing it I made my own, and while I was at it I thought it would be cool if the inner circle could spin, so I made it likewise.</description>

      <description>Installing any program on C:\Program Files, Windows default installation folder, requires administrative rights. It is possible, however, to install programs on the HOME folder without any special permissions. The default HOME path is set to C:\Users\yourusername\ and can be accessed by typing %HOME% on the address bar. I have found this approach makes it possible to have some autonomy from the IT department without compromising security.
Using this approach, the softwares will run just fine without any customization.</description>

      <description>Transfering data from my HD across a network, I have hit a bottleneck: the file transfer speed was dramatically slow. In fact, the transfer took more time to finish than it took to generate the files. It was an unnaceptable situation due HD constraints.
It turns out that the file being copied to another partition is virtually chunked, and each of them copied sequentialy. The more chunks the slower the transfer is, while larger chunks increase memory usage [1]â.</description>

 Hugo version in which the blog was built was v0.31, whereas the current one was v0.68.1. The cocoa development was abandonned and no updates were made to cope with hugo enhancements  Since I do like this theme and already had a fork of it I decided to try and upgrade it by myself, even though I have no experience with the go programming language or web development.</description>

The answer is to attach these files to an existing SQL server instance, instead of opening them directly with a tool such as SQL Management Studio.

      <description>Given the task to interact with an existing database I felt compelled to use the ORM abstraction instead of making queries with raw sql. My aim was to avoid the common pitfalls regarding making text templates for sqlqueries, prone to sql injection exploits, and enhance query composability.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found there are essentialy two ways to approach this task: through reflection or a declarative model. Both approaches are explained in the following sections.</description>

While creating a body to a POST request message, encoded with json, I verified that my requests were being turned down by the server. The issue was related to a behavior of the jsonlite package, one of httr&amp;rsquo;s dependencies which uses auto_unbox=TRUE by default.</description>

One exception is MatConvNet, a library that implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Matlab and has a good looking and helpful documentation.
The documentation stands out as it is produced with MkDocs, a static site generator based on markdown specific for project documentation.</description>

      <description>I have decided to give org mode blogging a go. Why org mode? The main reasons for this were:
 Abandon markdown: I always get confused by markdown markup choices. I find myself constantly reaching for markdown cheatsheet to find out how to insert a link. &amp;ldquo;Is it parenthesis or brackets?&amp;rdquo; gets me every time; Increase familiarity with org mode synthax to use it in my literary programming workflows in the near future (tangle+babel); Reduce friction to create new blog posts using the great ox-hugo by Kaushal Modi.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to read &lt;em&gt;uff&lt;/em&gt; files into R. This file format was developped at the University of Cincinnati to standardize the way vibration measurements are stored. It so happens there isn&amp;rsquo;t a library capable of importing &lt;em&gt;uff&lt;/em&gt; files into R, but there is one written in python and another for Matlab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Este conceito foi criado por ninguÃ©m menos que Donald Knuth (lembra-se do \( \LaTeX \)?). Knuth argumenta que os programas de computador devem ser tÃ£o legÃ­veis quanto obras literÃ¡rias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When trying to install the requirements for a course on coursera I found out that my system&amp;rsquo;s python distribution was a bit outdated. Since I did not want to change anything systemwide (and possibily break things) I decided to finally go for a virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
