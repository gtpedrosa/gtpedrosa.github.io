      <title>Using httr with JSON API&#39;s</title>

      <description>It is incredbly easy to make R interact with external API&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;ve found the httr vignette to be a great resource on how to make a wrapper to interact with them. However I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled in one quirk that is worth mentioning.
While creating a body to a POST request message, encoded with json, I verified that my requests were being turned down by the server. The issue was related to a behavior of the jsonlite package, one of httr&amp;rsquo;s dependencies which uses auto_unbox=TRUE by default.</description>

      <title>Exchanging data between Matlab/Octave and R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to read &lt;em&gt;uff&lt;/em&gt; files into R. This file format was developped at the University of Cincinnati to standardize the way vibration measurements are stored. It so happens there isn&amp;rsquo;t a library capable of importing &lt;em&gt;uff&lt;/em&gt; files into R, but there is one written in python and another for Matlab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
