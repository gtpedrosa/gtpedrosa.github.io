      <description>When Travis CI was acquired by Idera, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to cease its support for open source projects. This affected this blog since I overengineered it to learn some dev-ops skills. As result, I was forced to migrate the continuous integration (CI) tool from Travis to CircleCI. While I was at it, I took advantage and included a docker image for the build instead of declaring the dependencies installation as part of the CI build.</description>
