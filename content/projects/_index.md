My open source projects can be found on github. The main ones are:

* [CashDash](https://github.com/gtpedrosa/cashDash): Dashboard using [dc.js](http://dc-js.github.io) to track my expenses through time;
* [Tiano](https://github.com/gtpedrosa/tiano): Transcription of piano songs. If you have a bad ear such as me you would appreciate to have a piano sheet for every song you want to play;
* [DEMEC Thesis](/): Combined [UFPE Thesis](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~paguso/ufpethesis/) project with [ABNTex](https://www.abntex.net.br/) and applied ABNT rules of formatting to offer a latex template that complied with the guidelines of the mechanical engineering department of UFPE.
