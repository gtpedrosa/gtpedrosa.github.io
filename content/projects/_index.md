My open source projects can be found on github. The main ones are:

* [CashDash](/): Dashboard using [dc.js](http://dc-js.github.io) to track my expenses through time;
* [Tiano](/): Transcription of piano songs. If you have a bad ear such as me you would appreciate to have a piano sheet for every song you want to play;
* [DEMEC Thesis](/): Combined [UFPE Thesis](/) project with [ABNTex](/) and applied ABNT rules of formatting to offer a latex template that complied with the guidelines of the mechanical engineering department of UFPE.

Outside the computer you can find me mostly reading, playing piano/bass guitar or more rarely (sic) rock climbing and painting.
