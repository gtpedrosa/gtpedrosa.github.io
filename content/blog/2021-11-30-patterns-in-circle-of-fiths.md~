Last Sunday I decided to start (re)learning some music theory by myself. The objective was to learn the scales and the entrypoint for that was the circle of fiths. I don't know why, but I felt the need to hold the circle of fiths chart I was consulting in my own hands. So instead of printing it I made my own, and while I was at it I thought it would be cool if the inner circle could spin, so I made it likewise. Here's the outcome:

**Handmade circle of fiths chart**

The phisicality of it made me eager to play with this tool. Soon, I started gaining insights that might be obvious for a seasoned musician or someone who is proficient in theory. Nonetheless, here are some findings that I found amusing.


## 1.Notes Interwined {#1-dot-notes-interwined}

Notice how by starting at ****F****, it is possible to spot the following sequence: F\_G\_A\_B. The underscores just mean that a not is missing (is skipped). The interesting part is that you can fill the gaps with another sequence: <span class="underline">C\_D\_E</span>, yielding the full sequence FCGDAEB. So 7/12 notes of the circle are easily spotted as the white notes on the piano. But what about the other 5/12?


## 2.Accidental Simmetry {#2-dot-accidental-simmetry}

Well, if you pay close attention between ****F**** and ****B**** counterclockwise all notes have accidentals. Consider the sequence GDAEB, which are the notes of the circle clockwise after C. Now repeat them with a flat and you have found the remaining 5/12 notes from the circle!


## 3.Identifying key from Key Signature {#3-dot-identifying-key-from-key-signature}


### 3.1.Sharps {#3-dot-1-dot-sharps}

Add a semitone to the last sharp, or roughly add a note to it. For instance, what is the major key for a key signature with a single sharp (F#)? F+1=G.


### 3.2.Flats {#3-dot-2-dot-flats}

Drop the last flat. It does not work with the major key signature with only one flat, which is F. For instance ****Bb**** major has two flats: B and E. Drop the Eb (last flat in the signature) and you will have Bb itself.


## 4.Sharps and Flats Relationship {#4-dot-sharps-and-flats-relationship}

Being a circle one could wonder whereas sharps and flats are interconnected. If we take a closer look at the sharps and flats sequences:

-   ****Sharps:**** FCGDAEB
-   ****Flats:**** BEADGCF

If you read the sharps backwards you get the flats! Also, the sharps are just the sequence of the circle of the fiths ranging from F to B clockwise. Just refer to the image and it is easy to verify. If you go counterclockwise from B to F you get the flats.


## 5.From Major to Minor and Vice-Versa {#5-dot-from-major-to-minor-and-vice-versa}

The major and minor scales can be obtained through the following interval composition:

-   ****Major:**** TTSTT(TS)
-   ****Minor:**** (TS)TTSTT

Here T stands for tone and S for semi-tone. The funny thing is, if you remove the last two intervals of a major scale (TS) and transfer it to the beginning of the remaining intervals (TTSTT) you get the minor scale formulation. This realization is even cooler in the circle itself:

**Spun inner circle**

Here if you spin the inner circle by 1,5 tones (3 notes) you arrive at the same configuration as the major scale. So to obtain the relative minor to a major scale remove 1,5 tones from it. To derive the major from the minor add 1,5 tones. Example: What is the relative minor for D major? B minor. Try to see it on a piano, it is way easier. Another example the other way: What is the relative major scale to C# minor? E major.
