Last Sunday I decided to start (re)learning some music theory by myself. The objective was to learn the scales and the entrypoint for that was the circle of fiths. I don't know why, but I felt the need to hold the circle of fiths chart I was consulting in my own hands. So instead of printing it I made my own, and while I was at it I thought it would be cool if the inner circle could spin, so I made it likewise. Here's the outcome:

The phisicality of it made me eager to play with this tool. Soon, I started gaining insights that might be obvious for a seasoned musician or someone who is proficient in theory. Nonetheless, here are some findings that I found amusing.


## Notes Interwined {#notes-interwined}

Notice how by starting at ****F****, it is possible to spot the following sequence: F\_G\_A\_B. The interesting part is that you can fill the gaps with another sequence: C\_D\_E. So 7/12 notes of the circle are easily spotted as the white notes on the piano. But what about the other 5/12?


## Accidental simmetry {#accidental-simmetry}

Well, if you pay close attention between ****F**** and ****B**** counterclockwise all notes have accidentals. Consider the sequence GDAEB, which are the notes of the circle clockwise after C. Now repeat them with a flat and you have found the remaining 5/12 notes from the circle!


## Identifying key from Key signature {#identifying-key-from-key-signature}


### Sharps {#sharps}

Add a semitone to the last sharp, or roughly add a note to it. For instance, what is the major key for a key signature with a single sharp (F#)? F+1=G.


### Flats {#flats}

Drop the last flat. It does not work with the major key signature with only one flat, which is F. For instance ****Bb**** major has two flats: B and E. Drop the Eb (last flat in the signature) and you will have Bb itself.


## From Major to minor and Vice-Versa {#from-major-to-minor-and-vice-versa}

The thing which is fascinating in the circle of the fiths is that it can be easily derived. The major and minor scales can be obtained through the following interval composition:

-   ****Major:**** TTSTT(TS)
-   ****Minor:**** (TS)TTSTT

Here T stands for tone and S for semi-tone. The funny thing is, if you remove the last two intervals of a major scale (TS) and transfer it to the beginning of the remaining intervals (TTSTT) you get the minor scale formulation. This realization is even cooler in the circle itself:

Here if you spin the inner circle by 1,5 tones (3 notes) you arrive at the same configuration as the major scale. So to obtain the relative minor to a major scale remove 1,5 tones from it. To derive the major from the minor add 1,5 tones. Example: What is the relative minor for D major? B minor. Try to see it on a piano, it is way easier. Another example the other way: What is the relative major scale to C# minor? E major.
